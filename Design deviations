Used getUserByName rather than getUserByIndex in the setOfUsers class. - Done as there is no visualised index assigned to the User in the 
class e.g. no userNumber.

changePassword method in User not taking a string parameter to change the existing password to the new password. public void changePassword()
changed to changePassword(String newPass).
